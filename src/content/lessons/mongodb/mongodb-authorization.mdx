# MongoDB Authorization

Learn and practice how to enable authorization, create roles and users, and assign user roles on a database.

By default, a new MongoDB database doesn’t enable authorization, and has no users. MongoDB comes with default roles such as `root`, `userAdmin`, `userAdminAnyDatabase` when we install it.

The `root` is the superuser role that provides system-wide access to the user. It can also create custom roles using a combination of permissions.

To learn about authorization, we’ll create an admin user with the `userAdminAnyDatabase` role. Authorization is not required for the development.

The `userAdminAnyDatabase` role allows us to add or remove users for any database on MongoDB.

## Create a new user

We use the below steps to create a new user in MongoDB.

1. Use `mongosh` to connect to MongoDB.
2. Create the user with the desired role.
