# MongoDB Data Types

MongoDB stores documents in binary serialized format called **BSON**. Let’s go through each BSON type supported by MongoDB.

> Tip: Use `insert` and `find` to explore types quickly; we’ll dive deeper later.

## String

BSON strings are UTF-8, which allows us to use most international characters conveniently. In the below example, `name` is a string field.

```
db.tasks.insertOne({
  name: "Setup ToDo App",
});
```
