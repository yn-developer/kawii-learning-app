# Aggregation Pipeline - Part 1

Think of an aggregation pipeline as a conveyor belt: documents hop on, move through a series of stations, and hop off as shaped, grouped, and summarized results. In this first part, we’ll get comfortable with the belt itself and two core stations, $match and $group.

We’ll cover:

- $match stage
- $group stage

**Aggregation** fetches data based on a query, processes it, and returns computed results. It works in **pipelines**, each stage doing one job before handing documents to the next. Multiple stages can run, and pipelines can even mix data from multiple collections.

## What can a stage do?

Common stage capabilities:

- **Filter**: A filter operation is performed on a collection through a provided query.
- **Join**: Records from different stages can be added to the primary collection records.
- **Group**: The results of the previous stage can be grouped.
- **Sort**: The results of the previous stage can be sorted.
- **Operations**: Counting and merging records, or arithmetic operations.
- **Transforming the output**: We can transform a document or decide which fields to return as a result of the aggregation.
