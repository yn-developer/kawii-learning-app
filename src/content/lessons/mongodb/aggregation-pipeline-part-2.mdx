# Aggregation Pipeline - Part 2

Picking up from Part 1, let’s add the next “station” to our conveyor belt: `$lookup`, the built-in way to pull related data (left-outer-join style) into the stream.

## ＄lookup stage

We use the **＄lookup** stage to perform join operations with other collections. This stage performs a left outer join for each input document, and adds a new `array` field where the results for the join are added. Next, the transformed documents are sent to the next stage.

We use the below syntax to define the `＄lookup` stage.

```
{
  $lookup: {
    from: <target collection to join to>,
    localField: <field of the source document>,
    foreignField: <field of the target collection>,
    as: <output array field>
  }
}
```
